# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The motive of this project was to create a work day scheduler application using day.js and Jquery. This application allows the user to see the current date and time, along with timeblock hours of the work day. The user is able to enter any tasks for a certain hour, and save it to the application. The time blocks change colors according to the current hour, whereas the grey represents the passed hour, the red represents the current hour, and the green represents the future hours. This challenge solves the need for a physical calender or notebook when trying to plan the work day. Throughout this project, I was able to further my knowledge of javascript, day.js, as well as Jquery.

## Usage

This project contains time blocks from 9am to 5pm. The user can type in text into each time block, and click the save button to the right to save their task to their work scheduler. The user can differentiate between the current time and the past and future time, by the color changing timeblocks. The user can save tasks to certain time blocks and refresh the page and still see their tasks.
